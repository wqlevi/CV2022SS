\section{Cameral calibration}
It is a process of finding intrinsic and extrinsic parameters.
\section{Feature detection}
\textbf{Point features} describe the appearance of local salient regions. Features should be invariant to perspective and illumination.
Scale Invariant Feature Transform(SIFT) is one the way to detect features. It construct scale space by iteratively filering with different size of Guassian filter. The target feature(\textbf{interesting points}) are detected as local extreme in scaled images.
\section{Two-frame, structure-from-motion}
\subsection{Epipolar Geometry}
Two cameras were placed locations, using rotation and translation matrix to describe. The 3D object point, centers of the two cameras form a \textbf{Epipolar plane}

If homogenous vector has the last element is zero, then it's called infinity point; if the Epipolar points are infinity, the two cameras are parellel.
